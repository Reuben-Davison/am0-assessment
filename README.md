## Tasks

Commit your work as you see fit throughout working on this assessment.

1. Inside the project, create a directory titled `lib`
1. Inside `lib`, create 2 files: `it_1.rb` and `it_2.rb`
1. In the `it_1.rb` file:
  - Define four variables, each holding one of Ruby's basic data types
  - Write code that will print out a sentence using all four variables
  - Run the code in your Terminal to verify the print out is as expected
  - Write an if/elsif/else statement comparing your Integer to 10 and 100
1. In the `it_2.rb` file:
  - Define a variable that stores an empty Array
  - Add 3 elements (of the Integer data type) to the Array
  - Remove the last element of the Array
  - Check how many elements are in the Array
  - Iterate over the Array to print out each Integer multiplied by 3
  - Define a variable that stores a Hash with 4 key/values pairs, about your dog
  - Define another variable that stores a Hash with 4 key/value pairs, about your other dog
  - Define a variable that stores an Array. The Array should hold 2 elements; the Hashes you created in the previous steps.
  - Iterate over the Array and print out a sentence with at least 2 pieces of information about each dog
1. Inside `lib`, create a `it_3.rb` file
1. In the `it_3.rb` file:
  - Define a method that accepts one argument, an Integer, and returns the sum of that number and 4
  - Define a method that accepts three arguments, two Strings and an Integer that represent a name, month, and day. Write a birthday message to the name of the person, including their birthdate.
1. In the `it_3.rb` file:
  - Define a class named Dog
  - The Dog should have a dynamic name, favorite toy, and favorite food
  - By default, the dog should be happy
  - By default, the dog should be hungry
  - The dog should have an `eat` method that changes it from hungry to not hungry
